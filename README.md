# Design Patterns in TypeScript

This repository contains a collection of design patterns implemented in TypeScript. These design patterns can be used in day-to-day application development to enhance code quality and improve project architecture.

Each design pattern is organized in its own folder or project, making it easy to browse and understand. Below is a brief description of each design pattern included in this repository:

## Creational Patterns

- **Singleton**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Structural Patterns

- **Adapter**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect, allowing classes to work together that couldn't otherwise due to incompatible interfaces.
- **Decorator**: Adds new behavior or responsibilities to an object dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

## Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Clients can select the algorithm to use at runtime.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing clients to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.

Please feel free to explore each pattern in detail within their respective folders. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
